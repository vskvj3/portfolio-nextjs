### Extraction Layer  
**Sources:**  
- Blob files in Azure Storage Gen2  
- HTTP source from GitHub  
- Relational data from Azure SQL Database  

### Transformation Layer  
**Transformations performed using Azure Databricks with PySpark:**  
- **Data Cleaning and Reformatting:**  
  - Removed columns with more than 30% null values (invalid for analysis).  
  - Removed duplicate rows.  
  - Reformatted datetime data into an appropriate format.  
  - Renamed columns for better understanding.  
  - Extracted month and year information from datetime fields.  

### Visualization Layer  
- Visualizations performed using Azure SQL in Databricks.  
- Analyses focused on **SLA adherence** and **MTTR**.
